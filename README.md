# Airline-Satisfaction-Prediction


Airline industry growth is determined largely by customer satisfaction, governed by various factors. The competition in the industry is dominantly governed by the growing consumer demands for better service. It is imperative for industry players to understand which parameters play an important role in swaying passenger feedback, hence determining which services and technology play a key role in terms of customer satisfaction. In this project, we are predicting customer satisfaction based on meta data of survey entries and flight details from a US airline and identifying the critical factors that lead to customer satisfaction.
